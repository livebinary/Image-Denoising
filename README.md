# Image-Denosing
This Contains Verilog Code for Image Denoising using Median Filtering
Matlab is used for image pre-processing. includes capturing of image and adiing salt and pepper noise to image.
this noisy image act as an stimulus to the verilog implementation of image denoising core using median filtering.
